    <p>
      Young developer, passionate about web technologies. I learned to
      code in high school simply out of curiosity, to understand the
      reality of website development. It was a discovery that allowed me
      to blossom in an extremely rewarding field. I then went on to obtain
      a <span class='title'>BTS SNIR (Digital Information Systems and Networks)</span>
      . And to consolidate my knowledge and skills in web development, I
      trained as a <span class='title'>fullstack Javascript web developer</span> at
      La Capsule, on the <span class='title'>MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React Js, Node Js)</span>
      . And to give me some in-company experience, I worked for 2 years at
      Rakuten DX as a Front-end developer, to prepare the
      <span class='title'>"Application developer - JavaScript React" certification withOpenclassrooms.</span>
      Since Dec. 2023 i work at Inovéa as a Front-end developer.
